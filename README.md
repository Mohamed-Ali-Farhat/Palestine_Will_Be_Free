# **Palestine Truth Retrieval System**

This project uses an interactive AI-driven interface to provide answers about Palestine based on a set of documents. The system uses **Streamlit** for the web interface, **LangChain** for document processing and retrieval, and **Ollama** for generating responses based on context. This project aims to make crucial information about Palestine's history and rights easily accessible through AI.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Streamlit**: For creating the web-based user interface.
- **Ollama**: For generating responses based on the context retrieved from the documents.
- **LangChain**: For text processing, splitting, and working with vector stores.
- **Chroma**: A vector store to store and query document embeddings.
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: For handling and displaying images.
- **Python**: The primary programming language.
