# **Palestine Truth Retrieval System**

This project uses an interactive AI-driven interface to provide answers about Palestine based on a set of documents. The system uses **Streamlit** for the web interface, **LangChain** for document processing and retrieval, and **Ollama** for generating responses based on context. This project aims to make crucial information about Palestine's history and rights easily accessible through AI.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Streamlit**: For creating the web-based user interface.
- **Ollama**: For generating responses based on the context retrieved from the documents.
- **LangChain**: For text processing, splitting, and working with vector stores.
- **Chroma**: A vector store to store and query document embeddings.
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: For handling and displaying images.
- **Python**: The primary programming language.





In the example above:
- The **Bash section** starts with three backticks followed by `bash`.
- The **Bash section** ends with a closing set of three backticks.
- Everything that comes after the closing set of three backticks will no longer be part of the code block.

### Common Mistake:
If you forget to close the code block (missing the three backticks), then all the following text will appear in the code block, and Markdown will treat it as code.

### Example of What Can Go Wrong:

### **1. Clone the Repository**

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
cd repository-name

After this, you can proceed with the next steps.


























## **Setup Instructions**

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

### **1. Clone the Repository**

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
cd repository-name 

### **2. Install Dependencies**

You will need to install several libraries for the project to work. Below are the instructions for installing them manually:

#### **Ollama**

Ollama is used for generating responses using a large language model. Install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install ollama
